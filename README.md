1. Rewrite the pluralize function using the ternary operator:

```
var pluralize = function (word, number) {
 if(number === 1) {
  return word;
 }
 else {
  return word + "s";
 }
};
```

* The first step in functional programming is to write as much of your code in pure functions as possible. After that, you can make your functions more 'functional' still by not letting them rely on global variables; instead pass all needed variables as arguments. This makes your function even more modular, just input/output.

2. Rewrite the following code to be more functional:

```
var victim = {};

var getVictimInfo = function() {
 victim.name = prompt("Please enter your name:");
 victim.phone = prompt("Please enter your phone number:");
 victim.street = prompt("Please enter your street:");
};

getVictimInfo();

alert('Thank you! Victim entered: \n' + 
 victim.name + ", " + 
 victim.phone + ", " + 
 victim.street);
```
 
3. Write a function which removes falsey values from an array. A falsey value is one which evaluates to false when type coerced, which are the following: 0, null, "" (empty string), undefined, NaN, false.

4. Write two versions of the function: one that uses side effects and one that is pure.
